2025/02/10 8:03:11 pm GMT+8,"UNITEN has great academic potential, but there are several areas that need improvement, particularly in its facilities and management. Many classrooms and lecture halls have outdated equipment, including malfunctioning air conditioning and inadequate seating, making it uncomfortable for students. The library, while resourceful, requires better maintenance, more study spaces, and a stronger Wi-Fi connection. Additionally, sports and recreational facilities need urgent upgrades, as the gym lacks proper equipment and some sports courts are not well-maintained, discouraging student participation in extracurricular activities.

The university’s management and administrative processes also require improvement. Response times from offices such as finance and student affairs are often slow, leading to delays in resolving student concerns regarding fees and scholarships. Course registration is another major issue, with frequent system crashes and unclear guidelines creating unnecessary stress. Moreover, communication between the university and students needs enhancement, as important updates about policy changes, events, and academic matters are not always effectively conveyed. Addressing these issues will significantly enhance the student experience and ensure UNITEN remains a top choice for higher education.
